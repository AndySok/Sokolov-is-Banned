HW105 -- 'Tis Hard to Search for 'Processing'
2022-05-19
time spent: 1 hrs

WHAT THIS DEMO SHOWS:
* System of classes which can be used in Processing
* Our very own subclass! (which will be used in the final project)

WHY YOU CARE
* Baby steps, but it shows that we know how to RTFM
* The walls class will be later amended to be an implementation of a "thing" interface, which will be much cooler
